# Workshop aims

Introduce the main components of the Tidyverse
- readr (read files)
- dplyr, tidyr (manipulate data)
- ggplot2 (make awesome graphs)

I have to assume you have a basic knowledge of R

We don't really have time to cover all of the tidyverse (it is a huge universe!)

There are more functions in the tidyverse package, but this should be enough to get you going with data analysis!

If you have not done so already, please install all the packages in the tidyverse by running `install.packages("tidyverse")` in R Studio.

We will then load the package using `library(tidyverse)`.

---

# Importing data

--

With the `readr`, `haven`, `readxl` packages, we can load various type of data 

--

typical usage: `read_*()` where * can be csv, excel, spss

--


```r
library(tidyverse)

# Load data
df_csv &lt;- read_csv("./../data/sample_data1.csv")
*df_spss &lt;- haven::read_spss("./../data/sample_data3.sav")
df_excel &lt;- readxl::read_excel("./../data/sample_data3_datadictionary.xlsx")
```


--

*package*`::`*function* calls out a function from a package.

--



```r
df_spss &lt;- haven::read_spss("./../data/sample_data3.sav")
```

is the same as:

--


```r
library(haven)

# Load data
df_spss &lt;- read_spss("./../data/sample_data3.sav")
```
